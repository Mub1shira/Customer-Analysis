# Customer-Analysis
Machine  Learning_ Customer Analysis: clustering
In this project, the primary objective is to perform unsupervised clustering on customer data obtained from a grocery firm's database. Customer segmentation is a valuable approach aimed at categorizing customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics. By doing so, we can effectively tailor our products and services to meet the unique preferences and behaviors of each customer segment. This not only enhances the overall customer experience but also enables the business to address the specific needs and concerns of different customer types. Ultimately, customer segmentation allows us to optimize the value of each customer and make data-driven decisions that benefit both the customers and the business.
